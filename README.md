This project implements Huffman Compression for both text and images using Python and Tkinter. The application provides a user-friendly GUI to compress and decompress text as well as grayscale images.

Features
ðŸ”¹ Huffman Text Compression:
Enter text input in the GUI.
Apply Huffman encoding to compress the text.
Decompress and restore the original text.
Displays Huffman codes used for encoding.

ðŸ”¹ Huffman Image Compression:
Load an image from your system.
Apply Huffman compression to reduce image size.
Decompress and restore the original image.
Supports grayscale image compression.
